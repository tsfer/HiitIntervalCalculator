# HIIT Interval Calculator
Here you will be able to calculate our own customized intervals for HIIT workouts based on data from your cardiac stress test (CPX test).

HIIT, or "High-Intensity Interval Training" is a well documented and effective protocol/ training method for those looking to build strength, improve aerobic fitness, burn fat all from a relatively short (duration) training session.

If you are a beginner, newbie or just out of shape at the moment... A word of warning:
It's NOT recommended to anyone begin a HIIT program until they can exercise at 65-75% of their Max Heart Rate for 30 minutes or more. Interval training makes great demands on your body, in particular, your cardio-vascular fitness.
